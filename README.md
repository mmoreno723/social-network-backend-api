# social-network-backend-api

## Description
This application is a social media backend api. The application is run entirely through JavaScript and uses MongoDB and Mongoose to store databases without using SQL. A user can add multiple users, as well as their thoughts and a reaction to another user's thoughts. A user can also add a friend through the application. I was inspired to make this to give people a social media API database that uses NoSQL so they can hold lots of information.  

## Installation

To open this environment, here are the steps needed:

1. Open Terminal
2. Make a new directory titled "social-network-backend-api" (ensure you are in the location on your computer where you want the repo to be)
3. In GitHub, click the green 'Code' button and copy the HTTPS link
4. In Terminal, type "git clone" then paste the copied link and hit enter
5. Once cloned, check the status of the cloning by navigating to the directory where the repo is located and typing "git status"
6. If green, then the repo has been cloned and you can then drag the folder from your computer into vscode to run the environment

## Usage 
You may use this to view users, add users, add thoughts, add reactions, and view all the user's thoughts and reactions. In order to run this application, please run the following commands within your terminal once the repo has been cloned:
  1. npm i
  2. npm run start
  3. Navigate to Insomnia to view the routes to see the users and their thoughts
NOTE: Please note that there are some errors involving adding thoughts and adding friends.
